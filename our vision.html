        <h3>Even from the very beginning,...</h3>
        <p class="width">in April of 2017, I knew I wanted to start a successful program that allowed people to reach their goals and have fun while doing so. I started small with my family and friends, and later I expanded my clientele. As I helped people practice and become better athletes, I hoped to help as many people as I can on their fitness journey. As my business continues to grow, I want more people from all over west and even middle Tennessee to come to my company to improve whatever skill it is they need help in. I want to expand my services to kids, parents, and anyone who wants to improve or keep up with their physical routine. My passion and love for sports allow me to keep my vision bright. Choosing to use my services is a step to making our vision for the future even brighter. </p>
