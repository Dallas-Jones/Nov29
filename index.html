    <h3>Mission Statement:</h3> 
    <p class="width">Better Balance Sports &amp; Fitness is about enhancing athletes of all ages by providing 
      proper training that builds footwork, speed, agility and technique to their skill set. While 
      building these skills it is our mission to instill a work ethic that will translate to every 
      other part of their lives outside of sports that really determines their futures. Better 
      Balance is more than just about sports training, we are concerned with the totally being of 
      each athlete that we encounter. It is our mission to instill positive, productive, and vital 
      tools to be a productive citizen in society. Better Balance &amp; Fitness will never show any 
      favoritism, be bias towards or show lack of support for any athlete affiliated with us. It is 
      our sole purpose to see each and every athlete in life itself.</p>
